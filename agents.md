Best Practices for Building Semantic Models in Consumer Banking (Cards, Loans, Applications, and Servicing)
1. Introduction

Semantic models serve as the foundation for deriving actionable insights from consumer banking data. In this document, we outline a structured approach to building semantic models using Snowflake and Cortex Analyst, with specific application to membership, cards, loans, applications, originations, and collections. The goal is to establish repeatable standards that ensure scalability, performance, and clarity for end users across analytics and business teams.
2. Strategic Approach to Building Semantic Models
2.1 Think Before You Build

Before designing a semantic model:
 
Define the business problem clearly. (e.g., Membership growth in cards, delinquency trends in loans, servici ng channel efficiency).

Identify key entities. In consumer banking these often include: members, accounts, applications, products, services, credit scores, and transactions.

Map the grain of the data. Decide whether you are modeling at the member level, account level, or product level.

Determine performance requirements. Anticipate how often queries will run (daily reporting, ad-hoc analytics, or executive dashboards).

2.2 Staging Data with STTM and Sandbox

A best practice is to create STTMs (Semantic Transformation Tables) before exposing data to the semantic layer. The process:

Ingest raw data from source systems into staging.

Apply data engineering logic via transformation scripts (deduplication, normalization, derivations).

Write outputs into a sandbox table—a curated, single source of truth for your semantic model.

Expose the semantic view on top of this one sandbox table.

This approach is superior to connecting multiple raw tables directly into the semantic model because:

It simplifies complexity—business users interact with one curated view instead of juggling multiple joins.

It enhances performance—pre-joined, pre-aggregated data minimizes query execution time.

It improves governance—transformations are managed centrally in SQL scripts, reducing risk of semantic drift.

It ensures reusability—the sandbox table can be extended for multiple analytical use cases.

3. Crafting the Semantic Model
3.1 Dimensions

Dimensions define the contextual attributes of members and accounts. In consumer banking, examples include:

Demographic dimensions: Age group, generation, residency state.

Membership dimensions: Tenure, affiliation (military, civilian, veteran).

Product dimensions: Loan type, card type, application channel.

Best Practice: Always provide business-friendly names and maintain consistency (e.g., use MEMBER_RELATIONSHIP alias instead of MEMBER_TYPE).

3.2 Facts

Facts represent quantitative measures that drive KPIs. Examples include:

Loan balances, card utilization rates, delinquency counts.

Number of members by tenure bucket.

Application volumes, approval rates, servicing calls handled.

Best Practice: Ensure facts are additive and well-grained to prevent misinterpretation.

3.3 Metrics

Metrics are predefined calculations exposed for business users. For example:

Penetration Rates = (Number of members with product ÷ Total members) × 100.

Average Tenure = Sum(Tenure in years) ÷ Total Members.

FICO Prime Distribution using banded score ranges.

Best Practice: Round percentages to one decimal point, always use percentages rather than decimals, and ensure FICO scores do not exceed 850.

3.4 Filters and Aliases

Predefined named filters simplify recurring business queries. Examples:

Military Members in DMV (D.C., VA, MD).

Super Prime (FICO > 720).

Dormant vs Active Members.

Aliases (e.g., MEMBER_RELATIONSHIP instead of MEMBER_TYPE) ensure clarity and adoption by non-technical stakeholders.

4. Performance Optimization
4.1 Data Model Efficiency

Build narrow tables with only necessary fields exposed.

Use COUNT DISTINCT carefully (pre-aggregate if possible).

Pre-calculate common aggregates (e.g., monthly totals, tenure buckets) in the sandbox stage.

4.2 Query Optimization

Always filter using latest snapshot date (MAX(TIME_ID)), unless a timeline is explicitly requested.

Partition data by date and geography where applicable to reduce scan size.

Avoid calculations on raw FICO scores; instead, use banded dimensions (e.g., FICO_PRIME or FICO_BUCKETS).

4.3 User Experience

Expose verified queries (e.g., Total Members MOM Change, Military Member Breakdown) so business users have one-click access.

Provide clear lineage documentation for each field and metric, ensuring analysts know where values are derived.

5. Industry Alignment and Use Cases

This approach aligns with best practices in consumer banking analytics:

Cards: Monitor application trends, approval rates, balances, delinquency ratios.

Loans: Track originations, repayment patterns, refinancing activity.

Applications/Originations: Analyze conversion funnels by channel (branch, online, mobile).

Servicing & Collections: Measure call volumes, delinquency roll rates, resolution effectiveness.

By standardizing semantic models across these domains, institutions can deliver faster insights, improved governance, and higher confidence in reporting.





1) Best practices for a Semantic View Description

A strong description should help any analyst (or auditor) answer five questions in under a minute: What is this? What does it contain? At what grain? How fresh/accurate is it? How should I use it? Use the outline below and keep the tone factual and consistent.

A. Purpose & Scope

One paragraph on the business purpose (e.g., membership analytics for cards and loans; application/origination trends; servicing and collections).

Clarify in-scope and out-of-scope (e.g., “Includes consumer portfolios; excludes small business, wealth, and mortgage servicing prior to YYYY-MM.”).

B. Grain & Keys

Exact analytical grain (e.g., one row per member-month, or member as of latest snapshot).

Primary business key(s), surrogate keys, and any composite keys.

C. Refresh & Snapshot Policy

Load cadence (hourly/daily/monthly), snapshot date column (e.g., TIME_ID), and “latest snapshot” rule (e.g., always use MAX(TIME_ID) unless time series is requested).

D. Lineage & Inputs

Source systems and curated objects (STTM, sandbox table/view names).

Short bullet for the transformation steps that materially affect meaning (e.g., dedup rules, survivorship, conformed dimensions).

E. Critical Business Definitions

Enumerate definitions for the top 10–15 fields that commonly drive KPIs (e.g., “Active Member,” “Dormant,” “MEMBER_RELATIONSHIP,” “MilitaryStatus,” “FICO_PRIME,” “Tenure buckets,” “Application Status,” “Charge-off,” “DPD buckets”).

Link to a central glossary if you have one; otherwise keep the canonical phrasing here.

F. Standard Filters & Segments

Canonical filters your users will frequently apply (e.g., DMV region = {DC, VA, MD}; Military vs Civilian; Puerto Rico/APO categories; FICO bands).

Any named filters pre-built in the model.

G. Usage Notes & Gotchas

Rounding rules (e.g., show percentages to 1 decimal, never decimals).

FICO limits (e.g., treat <300 or >850 as NULL; bucket using FICO_PRIME or FICO_BUCKETS).

When to use COUNT DISTINCT vs pre-aggregated counts.

MOB vs member counts (for books analysis use MOB; otherwise member counts).

H. Performance Guidance

Recommended slicers to minimize scan (snapshot date, geography, product family).

Pre-aggregations/materialized views available.

Any clustering strategy, result caching notes, and warehouse sizing guidance.

I. Security & Compliance

Row Access / Masking policies (e.g., PII, military rank).

Approved audiences and data sharing constraints.

J. Versioning & Change Log

Semantic view version, last change date, and short notes on what changed (add/remove columns, logic updates).






Title
  <PRODUCT/DOMAIN>_ANALYST (v<MAJOR.MINOR>)

Purpose
  You are an analytics assistant specialized in <DOMAIN> data (e.g., Membership, Cards,
  Loans, Applications/Originations, Servicing, Collections) sourced from the <WAREHOUSE>.
  Provide concise, accurate answers with explicit field names and date ranges.

Persona & Tone
  - Data-driven, concise, business analytics.
  - Cite field names, filters, and snapshot dates in responses.

Query Logic (Rules of the Road)
  - Use <ALIAS_1> instead of <RAW_FIELD_1> in outputs.
  - When user mentions <REGION_ALIAS>, map to {<STATE_1>, <STATE_2>, ...}.
  - Always anchor to latest snapshot using MAX(<SNAPSHOT_DATE_COL>) unless a timeline is requested.
  - Use COUNT DISTINCT for membership counts by relationship/type.
  - Use % metrics with one decimal place; never show decimals for %.
  - For books analysis, use <MOB_COLUMNS>; otherwise member counts.
  - Segment credit using <FICO_BANDS_FIELD>; treat scores <300 or >850 as NULL.
  - When user requests product breakdowns, show product + specific products per member (>0).
  - Use <MilitaryStatus> to segment Active Duty, Civilian DoD, Reserves, Veterans, Retired.
  - When risk tiers are requested, use <FICO_PRIME> bands; do not use raw score above 850.
  - Prompt the user if DMP area or geographic states are missing for regional questions.

Time Handling
  - For “current” or “as of now,” use latest snapshot.
  - For MOM/YOY, show current vs prior period rows with deltas and % change.

Formatting & Output
  - Use business-friendly labels; include filter chips (state, product, snapshot date).
  - Provide a short “How this was calculated” note listing fields and filters.

Safety & Governance
  - Do not expose masked fields. Respect row-access and masking policies.
  - Avoid identifying individuals; aggregate at approved grains only.

Fallbacks
  - If a field is not present, respond with what is available and suggest the nearest equivalent metric.
