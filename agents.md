Perfect ‚Äî if the goal is to arm your AI with maximum decision-making power, then you want to think about the full attribute universe around applications, origination, and usage (trx behavior), and the decision questions that business leaders or portfolio managers would care about. I‚Äôll break this into Attributes and Questions stage by stage in the lifecycle.

üîÑ Lifecycle with Attributes & Decision-Making Questions


---

1. Application & Origination

Attributes:

Application channel (branch, digital, agent, affiliate)

Campaign/offer ID (was this from a targeted campaign?)

Customer type (existing vs new-to-bank)

Demographics (age, gender, income, region, occupation)

Credit bureau variables (score, inquiries, delinquencies)

Internal banking data (existing products: checking, mortgage, loan)

Approval decision (approved/declined)

Approved credit limit & interest rate

Time to decision (real-time vs manual review)

Activation status (activated Y/N, # days to activation)


Questions:

Which application channels deliver the best conversion & lowest risk?

Do targeted campaigns yield better-performing customers?

Which demographic/segment drives higher approvals but lower fraud?

What‚Äôs the optimal limit assignment for balancing usage vs risk?

What % of approved customers never activate the card?



---

2. Early Usage (First 90 Days)

Attributes:

First transaction type (POS, online, ATM, balance transfer)

First transaction amount & merchant category

Time-to-first-spend (days after activation)

Spend velocity (total trx count & spend in first 30/60/90 days)

Channel mix (POS %, online %, ATM %)

Cash advance frequency

Balance transfer indicator

Payment behavior (on-time, partial, missed)

Credit utilization (spend / limit %)

Fraud/alerts in first 90 days


Questions:

Does early high spend predict long-term loyalty or higher default risk?

What MCCs (merchant categories) indicate "healthy" customers?

Do balance transfer customers behave differently than retail spenders?

Which customers show early delinquency risk?

Which activation-to-spend lag is most predictive of attrition?



---

3. Mature Usage (Ongoing Month-to-Month)

Attributes:

Monthly spend volume & trx count

Spend concentration (top MCC categories vs diversified spend)

Recurring payments (subscriptions, utilities)

Online vs POS ratio

Revolving behavior (transactor vs revolver)

Payment-to-spend ratio (full pay, minimum, partial)

Delinquency aging (30/60/90+ days past due)

Credit utilization trends

CL increase/decrease requests

Fraud flags, disputes, chargebacks

Rewards redemption activity

Non-monetary: app logins, statement downloads, customer service calls


Questions:

Which spend patterns drive sustainable profitability?

What are early indicators of ‚Äúgoing inactive‚Äù customers?

Do revolvers (carrying balance) generate higher profitability net of risk?

Are online-heavy users more/less risky than POS-heavy?

What fraud patterns emerge in certain MCCs or regions?



---

4. Portfolio Health (Macro Level)

Attributes:

Active rate (% of open cards with activity in last 90 days)

Portfolio revolve ratio (interest-bearing balances vs transactors)

Net interest margin (interest income ‚Äì charge-offs)

Rewards cost vs engagement uplift

Attrition rate (closed or inactive accounts)

Vintage performance (compare cohorts by origination month)

Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)

Segment profitability (demographic, campaign, channel)


Questions:

Which vintages are most profitable or riskiest?

What‚Äôs the attrition profile by customer segment?

Are high-credit-score customers less profitable (due to transacting only)?

Where are systemic risks (macro region, MCC category, customer type)?

How do reward-heavy vs non-reward portfolios perform?



---

üß† Other Cross-Cutting Data Variables

To really empower your AI, don‚Äôt just focus on obvious card metrics ‚Äî feed in contextual and relational data:

Macroeconomic context: unemployment rate, inflation, interest rate environment.

Geospatial data: region/city (urban vs rural), fraud hotspots.

Time dimension: seasonality of spend (holidays, back-to-school).

Behavioral variables: digital engagement (mobile app usage, alerts setup).

Network attributes: if you can, link customers across product holdings (cross-sell, multi-product value).



---

üöÄ AI Decisioning Potential

With these attributes + questions, your AI could answer:

Which customer at origination will deliver the best risk-adjusted return over 12 months?

Which usage patterns flag a likely future delinquent?

How does application channel mix affect portfolio profitability?

What combination of spend + repayment predicts high attrition?

Which fraud behaviors cluster together, and how early can they be spotted?



---

üëâ This gives you a business-oriented 360¬∞ variable universe + strategic questions.
Would you like me to now map this into a lifecycle diagram (Application ‚Üí Early Usage ‚Üí Mature Usage ‚Üí Portfolio Health) with the key attributes/questions plugged into each stage ‚Äî so you can feed it visually to your AI design doc?
