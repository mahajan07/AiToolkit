Got it — you’ll want to make it clear in the emails that sessions will be scheduled this week so stakeholders know to plan ahead. Here are the revised drafts for each stakeholder group with that included:


---

1. High-Risk Underwriting Team

Subject: Input Needed: AI for BI – Supporting High-Risk Underwriting

Dear [Name/Team],

We are developing an AI-driven Business Intelligence product aimed at enhancing decision-making across functions. Since your team plays a critical role in underwriting high-risk accounts, your input is especially valuable.

We’d like to understand:

What underwriting challenges or decision points would you like AI insights to support?

Which data elements (e.g., applicant risk indicators, historical performance, external datasets) are most crucial to you?

What key questions should our product answer to improve your workflow?


This week, I will be scheduling a session with your team to walk through the initial concept and gather your feedback in detail.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

2. Compliance Team

Subject: Seeking Compliance Input: AI for BI Development

Dear [Name/Team],

As part of our AI-powered Business Intelligence product development, we want to ensure compliance considerations are embedded from the outset.

We’d appreciate your perspective on:

What compliance or regulatory requirements should the product explicitly address?

Which data points are most sensitive and require stronger governance or monitoring?

What concerns or risks should we prepare to answer during implementation?


This week, I will be scheduling a session with your team to review the product direction and gather your insights.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

3. Product Team

Subject: Aligning on AI for BI: Product Team Feedback

Dear [Name/Team],

We are building an AI-driven Business Intelligence product to support smarter, faster decision-making. To ensure product-market fit and cross-team adoption, we’d like your input on:

What business questions or use cases should the AI focus on first?

Which data sources and metrics are most critical for product development and decision-making?

What features or outputs would make the product most impactful for your team?


This week, I will be scheduling a session with your team to share our vision and collect detailed feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to also draft one short “calendar invite” style message you can reuse across all three groups when you actually set up the sessions? That way you can keep the invite consistent while the emails remain tailored.
